    "national-intensitaet-1": "The map shows the expected effects of an earthquake described in intensities. The intensity describes the strength of an earthquake based on the extent of the impact and the subjective perception of a person.",
    "national-intensitaet-2": "An intensity map is automatically produced based on various data, including the peak ground accelerations and ground velocities recorded at the seismic stations, local site conditions, and empirical instrumental intensity models.",

    "national-tote-5": "The estimated number of fatalities does <u>not</u> take into account the following values:",
    "national-tote-6": "Estimated number of fatalities due to damage to infrastructure (e.g. bridges, roads)",
    "national-tote-7": "Estimated number of fatalities due to the secondary effects of an earthquake (e.g. landslides, rockslides, fire)",
    "national-schutz-1": "The expected number of people seeking protection in the short and longer term is derived from the following values:",

    "national-schutz-4": "Estimated proportion of buildings that are no longer habitable due to damage",
    "national-schaden-1": "The estimated costs of building damage encompass both structural and non-structural damage, and they are derived from the following values:",
    "national-schaden-2": "Estimated number of slightly, moderately and heavily damaged or destroyed buildings",
    "national-schaden-3": "The value of these buildings",
    "national-schaden-4": "Estimated proportional loss of building value due to the damage caused",
    "national-schaden-5": "The estimated costs of building damage do <u>not</u> take into account the following values:",
    "national-schaden-6": "Movable building contents (chattels)",
    "national-schaden-7": "Losses due to the secondary effects of the earthquake (e.g. landslides, rockslides, fire)",

    "kantonal-verletzte-7": "Injuries resulting from the secondary effects of the earthquake (e.g. landslides, rockslides, fire)",
    "kantonal-schaden-1": "Damage to buildings falls within one of levels of damage (abbreviated to «DG»):",
    "kantonal-schaden-2": "Damage level 1: Negligible to slight damage",
    "kantonal-schaden-3": "Damage level 2: Moderate damage",
    "kantonal-schaden-4": "Damage level 3: Substantial to heavy damage",

    "kantonal-schaden-6": "Damage level 5: Destruction",
    "kantonal-schaden-7": "The estimated damage to buildings takes into account all buildings at damage level 2 or above. The damage to a building depends heavily on its construction and the nature of the local subsoil."
